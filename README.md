Data Analaysis for kidney disease risk.



Collaborator: Zihao Wang, Ziyang Hao, Man Li

Data set: High dimensional and small sample size data from serum of patients



As a exploratory analysis, we perform ONE-WAY-ANOVA, K-S test and Correlation Analysis. This real-life medical data shows strong correlation between features. Then we use machine learning technique to do feature selection and predictive analysis. We build Logistic-Lasso Regression model, Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier to analyze. All the code can be found in /src. 

Our results can provide direct application for the diagnosis indicator selection in medical diagnosis.
